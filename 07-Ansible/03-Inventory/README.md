### Let's re-run the ansible 
```
root@master:~//01-Inventory# ansible all -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
SSH password:
172.31.0.101 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
172.31.0.102 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {

    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
root@master:~//01-Inventory#
```


### Let's excute the operation againt individual hosts 
```
ansible 172.31.0.101 -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```

### Let's excute the operation againt a group [web] or [db] hosts 
```
ansible web -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```   
```
ansible db -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```

### Let's excute the operation on group of groups [dc] 
```
ansible dc -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```

### Let's check the dc group ansible authentication variables:  
```
ansible dc -i hosts -m ping
````




### Let's excute the operation on the common host btw the group [web] & [prod]:
```
ansible 'web:&prod' -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```
```
ansible 'db:&prod' -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```
```
ansible 'db:&uat' -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```

### Let's excute the operation on all host in the group [uat] & [prod]:
```
ansible 'prod:uat' -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```


### Let's excute the operation on all host in the group [uat] & [prod] & exclude the hosts belongs to ansible group:
```
ansible 'prod:uat:!ansible' -i hosts -m ping -u vagrant -k
```
